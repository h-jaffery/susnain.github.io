# Vanilla JS Weather App 

I made a web app to learn how to use APIs with vanilla Javascript. The API I used can be found at [weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/), and Forecast API (16 day / daily)
was used. It works by the user entering the city, which matches it with the API's json file that contains the current weather and the next day's forecast.

Future improvements could be working on is adding functionality where if the user enters the name of a country rather than a city, it defaults to the capital city of the country added, as the API only works with cities.

I also need to make the user able to press enter, with it acting as the submit button, as right now, the only way to get the output is by clicking on submit. Some error handling with the input (empty field or invalid city) would be nice too.
